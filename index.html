                        I have been on the ROBLOX platform for around 5 years
                        and in those years I have honed my developing skills.

                        The main genres I have experience in are <i>Fighting & Roleplay</i>, though I can easily expand outwards.
                        Whilst I have no notable contributions (such as large games), this is due to
                        my nature of solo developing and wanting to create unique experiences that come
                        to my mind.
